# DataTable Next Steps: Refactoring & Improvements

## 1. Further Modularization

- **Move more logic to hooks:**
  - Extract sorting, selection, and pagination logic into custom hooks if they grow in complexity.
- **Split large render blocks:**
  - Move table header, body, and empty state rendering into their own components for clarity.
- **Centralize constants:**
  - Move filter operators and other config constants to a separate file.

## 2. Type Safety

- **Remove all `any` types:**
  - Replace with generics or specific types for table data, columns, and handlers.
- **Make DataTable generic:**
  - Allow consumers to specify the row data type for better type inference and safety.

## 3. Performance

- **Memoize expensive computations:**
  - Use `useMemo` for derived data, especially for large datasets.
- **Consider virtualization:**
  - For large tables, use a library like `react-virtual` to render only visible rows.
- **Debounce search/filter input:**
  - Prevent excessive re-renders on every keystroke.

## 4. Accessibility

- **Improve ARIA attributes:**
  - Ensure all interactive elements are accessible by keyboard and screen readers.
- **Keyboard navigation:**
  - Support keyboard navigation for menus, pagination, and row selection.

## 5. Documentation

- **Add JSDoc comments:**
  - Document all exported components, hooks, and utility functions.
- **Usage examples:**
  - Provide example usage for DataTable and its subcomponents.

## 6. Testing

- **Increase test coverage:**
  - Add tests for all new components and hooks.
  - Test edge cases for filtering, sorting, pagination, and export features.
- **Use data-testid consistently:**
  - Ensure all interactive elements have stable selectors for tests.

## 7. Error Handling

- **Graceful error states:**
  - Show user-friendly messages for data loading, export, or parsing errors.

## 8. Style Consistency

- **Move inline styles to classes:**
  - Use utility classes or CSS modules for all styling.
- **Consistent spacing and alignment:**
  - Review layout for mobile and desktop breakpoints.

## 9. API/Props Cleanup

- **Simplify props:**
  - Pass only necessary props to subcomponents.
  - Use context if prop drilling becomes excessive.

These steps will help keep the DataTable codebase clean, maintainable, and scalable as new features are added.
