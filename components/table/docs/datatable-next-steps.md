# DataTable Next Steps: Refactoring & Improvements

> **Status Summary:**
>
> - Most next steps are **DONE**. Only virtualization, debounced search/filter, and JSDoc/examples remain. Context for props is not currently needed.

## 1. Further Modularization

- [x] **Move more logic to hooks:**
  - Sorting, selection, pagination, filters, and global search are all handled in custom hooks.
- [x] **Split large render blocks:**
  - Table header, body, and empty state are modularized into their own components.
- [x] **Centralize constants:**
  - Filter operators and config constants are in separate files.

## 2. Type Safety

- [x] **Remove all `any` types:**
  - Generics and specific types are used throughout.
- [x] **Make DataTable generic:**
  - DataTable is generic over row data; column types are inferred.

## 3. Performance

- [x] **Memoize expensive computations:**
  - `useMemo` is used for columns, data keys, and visible columns.
- [ ] **Consider virtualization:**
  - Not implemented (no `react-virtual` or similar).
- [ ] **Debounce search/filter input:**
  - Not implemented (no debounce logic for search/filter input).

## 4. Accessibility

- [x] **Improve ARIA attributes:**
  - ARIA labels are present on checkboxes and buttons.
- [x] **Keyboard navigation:**
  - Keyboard navigation is supported for pagination and selection.

## 5. Documentation

- [ ] **Add JSDoc comments:**
  - Not present in main files.
- [ ] **Usage examples:**
  - Not present in code (may exist elsewhere).

## 6. Testing

- [x] **Increase test coverage:**
  - Tests exist for filtering logic and hooks.
- [x] **Use data-testid consistently:**
  - `data-testid` is used for interactive elements.

## 7. Error Handling

- [x] **Graceful error states:**
  - User-friendly "No results" message is shown for empty data.

## 8. Style Consistency

- [x] **Move inline styles to classes:**
  - Utility classes are used for styling; minimal inline styles remain.
- [x] **Consistent spacing and alignment:**
  - Layout uses utility classes for spacing and alignment.

## 9. API/Props Cleanup

- [x] **Simplify props:**
  - Only necessary props are passed to subcomponents.
- [ ] **Use context if prop drilling becomes excessive:**
  - Not needed currently; prop drilling is minimal.

These steps will help keep the DataTable codebase clean, maintainable, and scalable as new features are added.
