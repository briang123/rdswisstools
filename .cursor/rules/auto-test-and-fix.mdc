# Auto Test and Fix Rule

- Always run tests after making changes, especially when fixing bugs or refactoring.
- If a test fails, automatically investigate and attempt to fix the issue without prompting the user for permission.
- Follow best practices for debugging and code quality.
- Minimize user input: do not ask for confirmation before running tests or applying fixes.
- Only prompt the user if a decision is required that cannot be made from context or best practices.
